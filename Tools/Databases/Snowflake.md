[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) is a cloud data platform that at it's core features a columnar-stored [[Data Warehouse|data warehouse]]. It's unique architecture separates compute from storage which allows you to scale the database to your needs and only pay for what you use.

### How to connect with SQL
1. Through snowflake web interface called Snowsight. We can create norebooks to rin sql and python code for building and maintaining data pipeline.
2. Worksheets - an interface for creating and running SQL queries.

## Snowflake Drivers and Connectors 
1. ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)
2. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
3. Connectors: Python, Spark, and more
4. Snowflake CLI - install on Linux, Windows, or Mac

## Datatypes

Common Datatype:
![[Pasted image 20250531153035.png]]

Unique Snowflake datatypes
1. Numeric - alias for number
2. TIMESTAMP_LTZ - timestamp with local time zone.

Converting datatype
1. CAST(<source_data/column> AS <target_data_type>) 
	Example: CAST('80' AS INT) or use this other syntax '80'::INT 
2. Conversion function: TO_VARCHAR(), TO_DATE()
3. DESC TABLE table_name - get information of all columns of the table_name

## Snowflake function
1. INITCAP() - cappitalizes each word in a string
2. CONCAT - use to joins expressions -

3. DATE & TIME Captions:
	1. CURRENT_DATE() / CURRENT_DATE - shows exact date
	2. CURRENT_TIME() / CURRENT_TIME - shows exact time

4. EXTRACT - extract specific parts from date/time/ timestamp

5. GROUP BY ALL - group by all column in the SELECT list 

## Snowflake Joins
1. Natural Join - automatically match columns and eliminate duplicate ones.

2. Lateral Joins - lets a subquery in FROM reference columns from preceding tables or views.

## Subquerying and CTE (Common Table Expressions)

### Why use CTE?
1. Managing Complex operations
2. Modular
3. Readable
4. Reusable
