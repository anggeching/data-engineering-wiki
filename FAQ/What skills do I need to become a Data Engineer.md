There is no one set of tools that will get you a job as a Data Engineer. It will depend on the company, industry, and the need for data engineering where you live. Unlike other guides, this guide will list the minimum requirements needed (generally) to get a job as a Data Engineer. For each role, skills are listed in order of general importance and what level of mastery is needed for that role.

**Data Engineering Roles:**

- [[#Junior Data Engineer]]
- [[#Data Engineer]]
- [[#Senior Data Engineer]]

# Junior Data Engineer

Despite the junior title, **data engineering is typically not an entry-level job** and therefore few of these positions exist. If you are starting from scratch, the best advice is to find an adjacent role and transition into data engineering. If you are already in an adjacent role such as: BI developer, SQL developer, or backend engineer then you probably have overlapping experience. See [[How can I transition into Data Engineering|How can I transition into Data Engineering?]]
